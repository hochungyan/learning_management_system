## CI/CD Workflow
This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment. The CI/CD pipeline includes:

- **Code Quality**: Linting and pre-commit hooks using `flake8` and `pre-commit`.
- **Testing**: Running tests with `pytest` and generating coverage reports with `coverage.py`.
- **Security Analysis**: Using CodeQL to identify security vulnerabilities.
- **Deployment**: Automated deployment to production on successful builds.

For more details, see the [CI/CD Workflow](CI_CD_WORKFLOW.md).
