# CI/CD Workflow

## Overview
This project employs a comprehensive CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions. The pipeline includes the following stages:

### Setup
- Checkout code
- Set up Python environment
- Install dependencies

### Code Quality
- Run linters with `flake8`
- Execute pre-commit hooks

### Testing
- Run tests with `pytest`
- Generate coverage report with `coverage.py`
- Upload coverage to Codecov

### Security Analysis
- Perform CodeQL analysis for security vulnerabilities

### Deployment
- Deploy to production on successful builds
